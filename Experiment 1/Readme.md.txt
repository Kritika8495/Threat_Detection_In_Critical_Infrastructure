EXPERIMENT 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: 
This experiment has three sub experiments to deduce the best hierarchical arrangement as 
well as pairs of the Statistical Parameteres (SP) for optimal performance metrics. The three
sub experiments are:

Exp 1.1: Taking one SP at a time
Exp 1.2: Taking pairs of SP 
Exp 1.3: Taking all SP

Datatset:
The New Gas Pipelined dataset is used here. 

Usage:
Open the notebook and run each cell sequentially to:
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset(New Gas Pipeline Dataset).
3. Apply feature ranking using SP.
4. Train the Random Forest model and evaluate its performance by using Selective Promising Feature Selection (SPFS) algorithm.

Dependencies:
1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-learn
5. SciPy
6. Matplotlib
